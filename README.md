# linchpin_label_maker
Minimum viable image labeling for machine learning, optimized for cross-domain transfer of (meta)data-only. This is ideal in niche scenarios where labeling and training are conducted on different (or distributed) enclaves, image (pixels) are available to both, and it's more efficient (or only possible) to transfer annotations-only and re-chip.
